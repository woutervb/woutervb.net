This is the first entry on this new blog.

Recently I moved my personal domain and server to a &#8216;hosted&#8217; variant. This means that from now on I no longer need to run a private computer to keep my site hosted.

The functions that are already moved are email en a weblog. The only item left to transfer are my photo albums. But for these I first need todo some research, as those foto&#8217;s will no longer be publicly available. And as the photo site will have to function as a backup of my private collection a lot of space is needed
